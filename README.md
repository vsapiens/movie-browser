# Movie API & React App

This project consists of a simple Node.js Express API for retrieving movie information and a React app for displaying the movie data.

## Components

- **Movie API**: A Node.js Express API that handles CRUD operations for movies.
- **React App**: A React application that communicates with the Movie API to fetch and display movie data.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the Movie API and React App on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (version 6.x or higher)

### Setting up the Movie API

1. Navigate to the Movie API directory:

``cd server``

2. Install the required dependencies:

``npm install``

3. Start the development server:

``npm run start``

The Movie API will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Setting up the React App

1. Navigate to the React App directory:

``cd client``

2. Install the required dependencies:

``npm install``

3. Start the development server:

``npm run start``

The React App will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

Refer to the [Movie API README](movie-api/README.md) for a detailed description of the available API endpoints.

## React App

The React App fetches and displays movie data from the Movie API. You can extend its functionality by adding more components, connecting to additional API endpoints, or adding more features like search, filtering, and user authentication.
